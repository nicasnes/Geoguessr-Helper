# Geoguessr Helper
 This is a Chrome extension to help in all aspects of Geoguessing.
 For the time being, it specializes in the Battle Royale game mode, which was introduced in late 2020.
 Battle Royale tells users only the country they are in â€” but curious minds want to know more! 
 Thus, the Geoguessr Helper was born to display the exact location in a country **after** a round ends.
 The extension **cannot** be used to cheat in Battle Royale lobbies.

 ## Installation
 Clone the repository, storing it in a directory called Geoguessr Helper.
 In Chrome, type [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in the URL bar. 
 Then, enable Developer mode in the top right and click "Load unpacked" in the top left.
 Select the directory, and you're good to go!

 This will change when the extension is uploaded to the Chrome marketplace.
 Installation process will vary on other extension-compatible browsers like Edge.
